<span class="caps" alt="G">reeting</span> cards is a massive industry, 
with Hallmark alone turning $4bn US in revenue in 2016. 

Imagine what we could do to improve the world with just a fraction of that money? 

wellsoon.nl is a social startup designed to turn the acts of gift-giving and well-wishing into a chance at a better world. 

We partner with independent creatives who design awesome cards.

Each card is paired with a charity that is attending to an important global struggle or cause. 

                               We sell the cards for 3 euros each.

1 eur goes to the designer, 1 euro goes to the charity, and 1 goes to us to cover our costs. We give the designers full credit and copyright retention, and ensure the charity is prominently displayed.
